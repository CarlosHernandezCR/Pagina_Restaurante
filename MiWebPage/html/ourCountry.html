        <p>The antipasto (appetizer) is often a platter of salumi (cold cuts), bruschette, or crostini (toasted or
            grilled bread topped with pâté or tomatoes) and/or vegetables prepared in oil or vinegar, or perhaps
            prosciutto and melon</p>
            
        <p>Next is the primo (first course), which may be a zuppa or miestra (soup), pasta, risotto (arborio rice
            boiled to be thick and sticky, usually studded with some vegetables), or polenta (a cornmeal mush, often
            mixed with mushrooms or a dollop of meat ragù). The secondo (second course) is usually meat, fish, seafood,
            chicken, or game. </p>

            <p>Aside from pizza, pasta is probably Italy's best-known export. It comes in two basic forms: pastasciutta
            (dry pasta), the kind most of us buy at the grocery store, and pasta fresca (fresh pasta) or pasta fatto a
            mano (handmade), the kind that most self-respecting establishments in Italy, even those of the most humble
            ilk, will probably serve.</p>

            <p>At the end of the meal, dig into a dolce (dessert) -- fruit, gelato (ice cream), tiramisu (sweetened,
                creamy mascarpone cheese atop espresso-soaked lady fingers), or formaggio (cheese) are traditionally
                offered.</p>

            Meals are usually accompanied by wine and a bottle of mineral water (con gas or senza gas/fizzy or still), and
            followed by an espresso. (One sure way to alienate an Italian waiter is to order cappuccino after dinner -- it's
            usually drunk only in the morning.) Espresso is often followed by grappa, a fiery digestivo liqueur made from
            what's left over after the winemaking process.
